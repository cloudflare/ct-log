Cheap/Certificate Transparency Log
----------------------------------

This repository contains code for a [Certificate Transparency
Log](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/) which is designed to use very
cheap cloud infrastructure, while still being performant and reliable enough for
production use.

Documentation on how to setup an instance of this log, along with an analysis of
the cost of operation, is available in the `docs/` folder.
